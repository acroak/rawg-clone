# Videogame Site

Make a clone of the popular game search site [rawg.io](https://rawg.io/).

## Goals
* light mode/dark mode toggle
* filter by genre
* filter by platform availability (xbox, playstation, pc, etc.)
* search able
* when list is loading display result skeleton
* sort games by relevance, date added, name, etc.

## Running the application
`npm i`
`npm run dev`

### Chakra UI
[Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/)

Supplies beautifully designed reuseable react components. Design is cosely related to how the site we are cloning already looks.

We will have to follow the installtion instructions and put the chakra provider into the root of our application.

### React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
